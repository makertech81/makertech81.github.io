	<p class="info" style="width: 50%">In April 2018, I along with many other participants, applied for a scholarship to WWDC 2018.  Though I ddi not make it, I am very proud for what I was able to pull off in such a short amount of time and it really shows my hard work in that time.  I could have done many things better: started earlier, not put it off until a week before, be more realistic with what I would accomplish in the very begginning, and more.  But all in all, it was an amazing experience and made me relive why I love programming so much: the freedom, expression, and creativity.  The project walks through a breif introduction with Apple's history.  It dives off into its roots and gives a one of a kind experience, with a powerful message to think different and stand up for justice.  You can check it out here for more.</p>
