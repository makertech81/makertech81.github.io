     The Public School Athletic League Football Officials Association, Inc. (PSALFOA) was
organized in 1961 in Brooklyn, New York. The organization was created to train and
provide certified football officials for the New York City Department of Education. The
PSALFOA is the most recent chapter to join the New York State Association of Certified
Football Officials, Inc. (NYSACFO), the governing body for football officiating in New
York State.
When the PSALFOA joined the NYSACFO in 1981, it completed the standardization of
football officiating throughout New York State. At that time we had been using college
rules (NCAA) to call our games. We transitioned to National Federation of State High
School Association (NFHS) rules and officiating mechanics. The NFHS is the governing
body for high school sports throughout the country.
Football officiating in New York State is governed by the â€œFive Point Program&quot;; and
agreement between the officials and the New York State Public High School Athletic
Association (NYSPHSAA). The 5 points are:
1) Observe the rules and regulations of their chapter and the NYSACFO
2) Attend a minimum of six local chapter meetings where NFHS and NYSACFO
rules and mechanics are discussed
3) Annual pass NFHS Part 2 rules exam and any other exams required by the local
chapter
4) Be listed with the NYSPHSAA and NYSACFO Executive Secretaries
5) Give evidence of proficient knowledge of football officiating field mechanics
