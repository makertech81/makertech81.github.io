	<p class="info" style="width: 50%">Hey there, I'm TJ.  I'm a 15 year-old genius (my own words) trying improve the world<!--Make an impact on, help fix, make the world a better place--> through my passion of science and technology.  Based in New York (of course, thats where all good things come) and I'm constantly bouncing between LI and the boroughs. I have several interests/hobbies among them include running, programming, drone racing, and learning about new things.  I have been programming for over 5 years now and have enjoyed every minute of it (for the most part). This website helps me showcase a portfolio of the projects I'm most proud of.  </p>
